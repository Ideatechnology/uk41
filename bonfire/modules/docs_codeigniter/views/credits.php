<p>CodeIgniter was originally developed by <a href="http://www.ellislab.com/">Rick Ellis</a> (CEO of
<a href="http://ellislab.com/">EllisLab, Inc.</a>).  The framework was written for performance in the real
world, with many of the class libraries, helpers, and sub-systems borrowed from the code-base of
<a href="http://www.expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a>.</p>

<p>It is currently developed and maintained by the ExpressionEngine Development Team.<br />
Bleeding edge development is spearheaded by the handpicked contributors of the Reactor Team.</p>

<p>A hat tip goes to Ruby on Rails for inspiring us to create a PHP framework, and for
bringing frameworks into the general consciousness of the web community.</p>
