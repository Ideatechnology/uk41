<h1>Writing Documentation</h1>

<p>To help facilitate a consistent, easy-to-read documentation style for CodeIgniter projects, EllisLab is making the markup and CSS from the CodeIgniter user guide freely available to the community for their use. For your convenience, a template file has been created that includes the primary blocks of markup used with brief samples.</p>
