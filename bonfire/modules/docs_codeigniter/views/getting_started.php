<h1>Getting Started With CodeIgniter</h1>

<p>Any software application requires some effort to learn.  We've done our best to minimize the learning
curve while making the process as enjoyable as possible.

<p>The first step is to <a href="../installation/index.html">install</a> CodeIgniter, then read
all the topics in the <strong>Introduction</strong> section of the Table of Contents.</p>

<p>Next, read each of the <strong>General Topics</strong> pages in order.
Each topic builds on the previous one, and includes code examples that you are encouraged to try.</p>

<p>Once you understand the basics you'll be ready to explore the <strong>Class Reference</strong> and
<strong>Helper Reference</strong> pages to learn to utilize the native libraries and helper files.</p>
